EXAMPLES OF GOOD INVESTMENT WRITING:

❌ BAD: "NVDA is a good stock to buy because AI is growing."

✅ GOOD: "NVDA at $485 offers 40% upside to our $680 price target. The thesis: H100 demand remains strong (12-month backlog), data center revenue growing 200% YoY, and gross margins expanding to 75%. Key catalyst: Jan 22 earnings likely to show $20B+ quarterly revenue. Risk: China export restrictions could impact 15% of revenue. Action: BUY under $500 with stop loss at $450."

❌ BAD: "Bitcoin is going up."

✅ GOOD: "BTC at $48,500 is testing critical resistance at $50K. If it breaks and holds above $50K on volume, next target is $58K (+20%). Supporting factors: Bitcoin ETF inflows averaging $850M/week, institutional adoption accelerating, and halving in 90 days. However, if it fails at $50K, expect pullback to $44K support. Risk/reward favors long exposure here. Entry: $48K-$49K. Target: $58K. Stop: $44K."

❌ BAD: "This stock could go up or down."

✅ GOOD: "Three scenarios for PLTR over next 90 days:
- Bull case (40% probability): Wins $500M+ government contract → $28 (+40%)
- Base case (40% probability): Steady enterprise growth → $22 (+10%)  
- Bear case (20% probability): Q1 miss on guidance → $16 (-20%)
Expected value: +12%. Risk/reward: 2:1. Position size: 3-5% of portfolio."

EXAMPLE FULL OPPORTUNITY WRITE-UP:

"**NVIDIA (NVDA) - BUY**
**Price:** $485 | **52W Range:** $380-$520 | **Market Cap:** $1.2T

**The Thesis:**
NVDA is the dominant AI infrastructure play with 90%+ market share in data center GPUs. H100 chips have 12-month backlog, and the upcoming H200 (launching Q1) offers 2x performance at similar price points. With hyperscalers (MSFT, GOOGL, META, AMZN) spending $200B+ on AI infrastructure in 2025, NVDA is the primary beneficiary.

Current valuation of 35x forward earnings seems high but justified by 100%+ revenue growth and expanding margins. Compared to other "Magnificent 7" stocks trading at 25-30x, NVDA's growth premium is warranted.

**Key Catalysts:**
- Jan 22: Q4 earnings (expect $20B+ revenue, up 200% YoY)
- Q1 2025: H200 launch (could drive 20% ASP increase)
- March: GTC conference (new product announcements)

**Fundamentals:**
- Revenue: $60B (2024E), $90B (2025E) - 50% growth
- Gross margin: 75% (expanding from 70%)
- P/E: 35x forward (vs. 25x sector average)
- Free cash flow: $30B+ annually

**Technical Setup:**
- Consolidating in $470-$500 range after 240% run
- Breaking above $500 targets $580 (previous high)
- Strong support at $450 (50-day MA)
- RSI: 58 (neutral, room to run)

**Risks:**
1. China export restrictions (15% of revenue at risk)
2. Competition from AMD, custom chips (GOOGL TPU, AMZN Trainium)
3. Valuation compression if growth slows
4. Supply chain disruptions (TSMC dependency)

**Price Targets (12-month):**
- Bull case: $680 (+40%) - H200 drives margin expansion, China risk resolves
- Base case: $580 (+20%) - Steady growth, margins hold
- Bear case: $380 (-22%) - Competition intensifies, China revenue lost

**Action:** BUY under $500 with 5% portfolio allocation. Stop loss: $450. Target: $580-$680. Hold through Jan 22 earnings."
