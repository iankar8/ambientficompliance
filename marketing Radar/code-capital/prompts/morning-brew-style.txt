WRITING RULES:
1. **Hook immediately** - First sentence must grab attention
2. **Get to the point** - No throat-clearing, no "recently"
3. **Show don't tell** - Use specific examples, numbers, quotes
4. **Make it relevant** - Always answer "so what?" and "why now?"
5. **Be opinionated** - Have a take, don't just report
6. **Use active voice** - "Circle filed for IPO" not "An IPO was filed by Circle"
7. **Short sentences** - Vary length but default to punchy
8. **Conversational** - Write like you're explaining to a smart friend
9. **Data-driven** - Include numbers, metrics, trends
10. **Forward-looking** - What does this mean for the future?

STRUCTURE TEMPLATES:

LEAD STORY (150-200 words):
"[Attention-grabbing opening]. [What happened]. [Why it matters]. [What's next]."

Example:
"Stablecoins just crossed $200B in market cap, and your bank's innovation team should be paying attention. USDC processed more transactions last week than Venmo and Cash App combined. PayPal's PYUSD is now live on Solana. And Circle—the company behind USDC—just filed to go public with $1.5B in annual revenue.

Here's why this matters: Stablecoins are becoming the rails for global payments, and banks are getting left behind. While JPMorgan has JPM Coin (used by exactly one client), crypto-native stablecoins are processing $10T+ annually. The gap is widening.

What's next: Expect every major bank to announce a stablecoin initiative in 2025. The question isn't if, but how—and whether they'll build, buy, or partner."

QUICK HITS (5-7 bullets, 1-2 sentences each):
"**[Company/Topic]:** [What happened]. [Why it matters or what's next]."

Examples:
"**Stripe launches stablecoin payments:** Now supports USDC on Solana, Ethereum, and Polygon. 100+ merchants already live including Shopify stores."

"**Fed releases AI guidance for banks:** New framework requires human oversight for credit decisions. Translation: AI can recommend, but humans must approve."

"**Visa's stablecoin bet:** Processed $2.5B in USDC transactions last quarter. Quietly becoming the biggest stablecoin on-ramp."

DEEP DIVE (300-400 words):
"[Provocative headline as opening]. [Set up the trend]. [Explain what's happening]. [Why now]. [What it means]. [Prediction or recommendation]."

Example structure:
"Every bank will issue a stablecoin by 2026. Here's why.

[Paragraph 1: The trend - what's happening now]
[Paragraph 2: The why - underlying forces driving this]
[Paragraph 3: The evidence - specific examples and data]
[Paragraph 4: The implications - what this means]
[Paragraph 5: The prediction - where this is headed]"

CHART OF THE WEEK:
"[Chart title]. [What the data shows]. [Why it matters]."

Example:
"Stablecoin market cap hit $180B, up 40% YoY. USDC is gaining share (35% → 42%) while USDT is losing it (55% → 48%). The shift? Institutional adoption favors regulated stablecoins."

WHAT WE'RE WATCHING:
"**[Topic/Company]:** [1-2 sentences on why this is interesting]."

Examples:
"**Plaid's banking license application:** If approved, the data aggregator becomes a bank. Every fintech's dream—or nightmare."

"**AI credit scoring startups:** Upstart, Zest AI, and others claim 20%+ better default prediction. Banks are testing but not yet deploying at scale."

VOICE CHARACTERISTICS:
- Insider (we understand the industry deeply)
- Skeptical (we've seen hype cycles before)
- Practical (what can you actually do with this?)
- Pattern-recognition (connecting dots others miss)
- Slightly contrarian (willing to challenge consensus)

SENTENCE STARTERS TO USE:
- "Here's what's actually happening..."
- "Translation:"
- "The quiet part out loud:"
- "What everyone's missing:"
- "Plot twist:"
- "The real story:"
- "Here's why this matters:"
- "What's next:"

SENTENCE STARTERS TO AVOID:
- "Recently..."
- "It's interesting that..."
- "Many people think..."
- "In today's world..."
- "As we all know..."
- "It goes without saying..."

FORMATTING:
- **Bold** for company names, key terms, section headers
- Use em dashes for asides—like this
- Numbers: $1.5B not $1,500,000,000
- Percentages: 40% (no decimal unless needed)
- Keep paragraphs to 2-4 sentences max

EXAMPLES OF GOOD VS BAD:

❌ BAD: "Artificial intelligence is increasingly being adopted by financial institutions for various use cases including fraud detection and customer service."

✅ GOOD: "Banks are finally using AI for more than chatbots. JPMorgan's fraud detection AI caught $1B in suspicious transactions last quarter—10x more than human analysts."

❌ BAD: "Circle, a leading stablecoin issuer, recently announced plans to go public."

✅ GOOD: "Circle filed for an IPO. The USDC issuer is profitable ($1.5B revenue) and wants a $5B valuation. Translation: Stablecoins are now a real business, not a crypto experiment."

❌ BAD: "Stablecoins have seen significant growth in recent months."

✅ GOOD: "Stablecoins processed $10T in transactions last year. That's more than Visa. And your bank probably doesn't have a stablecoin strategy."
