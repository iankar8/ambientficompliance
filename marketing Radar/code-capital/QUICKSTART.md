## ðŸš¨ Common Pitfalls

### Week 1 Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Over-engineering**
   - Don't build fancy features yet
   - Focus on core pipeline
   - Ship something basic that works

2. **Perfectionism**
   - Your first newsletter will be rough
   - That's okay! Iterate quickly
   - Feedback > polish

3. **Too many sources**
   - Start with 10-15 quality sources
   - Add more later
   - Quality > quantity

4. **Ignoring voice quality**
   - Spend time on voice clone
   - Test extensively
   - Bad audio = instant unsubscribe

5. **No backup plan**
   - What if AI fails?
   - What if Sesame is down?
   - Have manual fallback
