- [ ] Fix signal_id linking in database inserts

### 🎯 Upcoming Tasks
- [ ] Build 5 core N8N workflows in UI

- [ ] Add error handling and retry logic to agents
- [ ] Connect Browserbase for evidence collection
- [ ] Create workflow execution monitoring dashboard
- [ ] End-to-end pipeline testing

## 🔴 Roadblocks & Resolutions

### Active Roadblocks
1. **Docker File Sharing Issue** (Critical)
   - Error: `/Users/iankar/marketing Radar/n8n-backups` not shared with Docker
   - Impact: Cannot start N8N container
   - Solution: Configure Docker Desktop → Preferences → Resources → File Sharing
   
2. **Incomplete Agent Implementations** (High)
   - Signal Scout: Firecrawl integration stubbed with TODO
   - Researcher: Web search not implemented
   - Impact: Agents cannot execute real workflows
   - Solution: Implement external service integrations

3. **Missing API Routes** (High)
   - No `/app/api/agents/` routes created yet
   - Impact: N8N cannot call agents
   - Solution: Create 5 API route handlers per N8N integration plan

### Resolved Issues

## 🔥 Patterns & Insights

### Recurring Patterns
**Good Patterns:**
- Clean separation of concerns (agents, lib, components)
- Type-safe N8N client with comprehensive TypeScript types
- Modular agent structure allows independent development
- Comprehensive documentation created upfront

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Multiple TODO comments indicate incomplete implementations
- Missing error handling in agent functions
- No retry logic for external API calls yet

### Technical Debt
1. **Signal ID Linking** - Outreach and dossier records not linking to signals properly
2. **Error Handling** - No try/catch blocks or retry logic in agents
3. **API Route Layer** - Missing abstraction layer between N8N and agents
4. **Environment Variables** - Some services configured but not yet in .env.example

### Performance Metrics
*Metrics will be added as features are deployed*

## 🛠 Rule Updates & Learnings

### Recent Rule Changes
*No rule changes yet*

### Key Learnings
1. **N8N vs Temporal Trade-off** - Chose N8N for faster setup and visual workflow design
2. **Docker Configuration** - File sharing must be configured for volume mounts
3. **Agent Design Pattern** - Each agent should be callable via API route for N8N integration
4. **Documentation First** - Comprehensive planning docs (Architecture, N8N Plan) accelerate development
