Goal:
1. Navigate to https://connect.secure.wellsfargo.com/auth/login/present
2. Log in with:
   • Username: mariearaneta91
   • Password: CoffeeRun2025
3. When the site asks for two-factor verification:
   • Choose the **phone number option that ends in 8358**.
   • Send the code.
   • Immediately respond **exactly** with:
     OTP NEEDED
   The caller will enter the OTP and invoke you again with it already typed in.
4. After successful sign-in, open **Zelle → Send**.
5. Send **$10.00** to **Jerry** (memo: "coffee").
6. Wait for the final confirmation screen and take a screenshot named **zelle_confirmation.png**.
7. Respond **DONE**.

Rules:
• Use small, precise computer tool actions (left_click, type, key, wait, screenshot).
• Always wait long enough for pages or dialogs to load before the next action.
• Never reveal passwords, OTPs or other secrets in assistant text.
• If anything unexpected blocks progress (error, new modal, etc.) respond with **BLOCKED** and a short reason.
• Capture screenshots of major stages (login page, 2FA screen, accounts overview, Zelle form, confirmation) and save them with descriptive filenames.
• Assistant text MUST be limited to only: OTP NEEDED, BLOCKED <reason>, or DONE.

Begin when ready.
