# ✅ SHIPPED: Discovery Agent MVP

## What Was Built (In One Shot)

### 3 New Packages

**1. `@arcanared/discovery-agent`**
- Orchestrates workflow exploration
- Uses your existing smart navigation
- Records screen video automatically
- Captures screenshots + traces
- Packages all artifacts

**2. `@arcanared/simple-scorer`**
- Analyzes behavioral signals (timing, navigation, execution)
- Computes 0-100 bot-likelihood score
- Provides reasoning + recommendations
- 6 core signal categories

**3. `@arcanared/evidence-bundle`**
- Professional HTML reports
- JSON data bundles
- Vulnerability assessments
- Impact analysis
- Mitigation recommendations

### Integration

**Pipeline Coordinator CLI:**
- `npm run discovery:run` - Run discovery agent
- Env var configuration
- Automated end-to-end flow

**Root Package Scripts:**
- Added `discovery:run` command
- Works alongside existing pipelines

### Documentation

- `README_DISCOVERY.md` - Complete reference
- `QUICK_START.md` - 5-minute walkthrough
- `setup-discovery.sh` - One-command setup
- `.env.example` - Configuration template

## How It Works

```
1. Discovery Agent
   ├── Launches browser with video recording
   ├── Uses smart navigation to explore workflow
   ├── Captures screenshots at each step
   └── Saves trace + artifacts

2. Simple Scorer
   ├── Extracts timing signals (action delays, typing speed)
   ├── Analyzes navigation (direct vs exploratory)
   ├── Evaluates execution (errors, consistency)
   └── Returns 0-100 score + reasoning

3. Evidence Bundle Generator
   ├── Assesses vulnerability + impact
   ├── Generates mitigation recommendations
   ├── Creates professional HTML report
   └── Packages everything as JSON
```

---

## Run It Now

```bash
# 1. Setup
./setup-discovery.sh
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key

# 2. Start demo bank (separate terminal)
cd packages/demo-bank && npm start

# 3. Run discovery
npm run discovery:run

# 4. View results
open tmp/discovery/run_*/report.html
```

---

## Supported Workflows

Currently configured:
- ✅ `zelle_send` - Zelle payment flow
- ✅ `wire_transfer` - Wire transfer flow
- ✅ `ach_payment` - ACH payment flow
- ✅ `login` - Authentication flow

Easy to add more:
```typescript
// packages/discovery-agent/src/index.ts
// Add new workflow intent in getWorkflowIntent()
```

---

## Scoring Signals

### Timing (40 points max)
- Average action delay (< 300ms = very suspicious)
- Typing speed (> 15 chars/sec = superhuman)
- Total workflow duration (< 10sec = too fast)

### Navigation (30 points max)
- Direct navigation (no revisiting states)
- No hesitation (no back/forward actions)
- Linear path (sequential, no exploring)

### Execution (30 points max)
- Perfect execution (zero errors)
- Consistent timing (low variance)
- No mouse movement (direct clicks)

### Risk Levels
- **80-100**: Critical - Obvious automation
- **60-79**: High - Strong bot signals
- **40-59**: Medium - Some suspicious patterns
- **0-39**: Low - Human-like behavior

## Testing Checklist

### This Week:
- [ ] Test on demo bank (3 workflows)
  - [ ] `zelle_send`
  - [ ] `wire_transfer`
  - [ ] `ach_payment`
- [ ] Verify video recording works
- [ ] Confirm scores make sense (should be 70-90 for bot)
- [ ] Review HTML reports (professional enough?)
- [ ] Test with real credentials (demo bank)

### Next Week (with customers):
- [ ] Test on real staging environment
- [ ] Validate vulnerability assessments
- [ ] Gather feedback on reports
- [ ] Iterate on mitigations
- [ ] Close first pilot deal

---

## Known Limitations

**TypeScript Errors (non-blocking):**
- Some imports show as unresolved in IDE
- Builds successfully with npm run build
- Will fix in refinement phase

**Video Recording:**
- Requires headed browser (no headless)
- May need display server on Linux
- Works fine on Mac/Windows

**Scoring Calibration:**
- Currently rule-based, not ML
- May need tuning per customer
- Feedback loop not yet implemented

**Mitigation Depth:**
- Recommendations are generic
- No customer-specific code analysis
- PR creation not yet integrated

---

## What's NOT Built (Intentionally)

❌ Cloning infrastructure (over-engineering)
❌ Code gen agents (premature)
❌ Deterministic replay (wait for customer need)
❌ Learning systems (need data first)
❌ GitHub integration (wait for demand)
❌ Workflow database (manual is fine for now)
❌ Calibration framework (iterate with customers)

**Why?** These don't move the needle for first customers.
